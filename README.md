This package provides the basic tools to manage configuration files that hold information
in the format of key - value pairs. Every value is of type string.

The package is on hackage so it suffices to run:

```sh
$ cabal update
$ cabal install minimal-configuration
```

For a configuration library with more "meat" to it, I recommend you take a look at 
[configurator](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/configurator).

For more information and API documentation see [the hackage page](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/minimal-configuration).
